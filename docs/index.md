# Coursectl

The `coursectl` is a CLI tool for managing courses on instances of [community app][]. Currently, this is used for authoring courses on [Mon School][].

[community app]: https://github.com/fossunited/community
[Mon School]: https://mon.school/

This allows the course creators to:

- write the course material in markdown using their favorite editor
- preview it locally using mkdocs for material
- push the changes to the server using `coursectl`

This also allows the course creators to push the course to multiple sites. For example, keep pushing to a staging website to show the preview with a small group and push to the main site after it is ready.
